The history of the Juneteenth holiday began during the Civil War.  On Jun!e 19, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed “An Act to secure Freedom to all Persons within the Territories of the United States.” The act banned slavery in the Union (except as the punishment for a crime). On June 19, 1865 Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas to enforce General Order No. 3. The order enforced the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas. It also stated that all 250,000 enslaved people in the state were free. The thirteeenth amendment banning slavery in the United States was eventually passed and ratified by all states in December 1865.

Beginning in 1866, formerly enslaved people celebrated June 19th annually as their freedom day. In 2007 a law was enacted in North Carolina recognizing Juneteenth National Freedom Day.  In 2021 the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act was signed into law making it a federally recognized holiday.
